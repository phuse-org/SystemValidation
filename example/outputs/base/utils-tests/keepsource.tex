Now a chunk starting with a comment, lost in R 2.12.0 patched:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
R> ## This is an initial comment line. Let's hope it's not being lost
R> "Above there's a comment."
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] "Above there's a comment."
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
R> 1:10 # a comment here is preserved
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
R> pi   # also, there's one the next (last) line - which used to get lost
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 3.1416
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
R> ## and a last comment here ... lost also in earlier R versions
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}

and some more text.
